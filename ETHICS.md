# Ethical Considerations

## The Ethics Gate
CT applies *under ethical constraints*. Minimizing CT is NOT:
- License to harm in pursuit of "truth"
- Justification for disclosure without consent
- Excuse for violating privacy/autonomy

## CT is bounded by:
1. **Consent**: Information sharing requires permission
2. **Harm prevention**: Truth-telling that causes unjust harm is constrained
3. **Privacy**: Some information should remain confidential
4. **Context**: CT applies within ethical frameworks, not replacing them

## Example: Medical Information
- High CT: Doctor knows diagnosis, lies to patient
- Lower CT: Doctor knows, tells truth *with consent and care*
- Not always lowest CT: Doctor broadcasts private medical info publicly

Truth optimization occurs *within* ethical boundaries, not across them.
