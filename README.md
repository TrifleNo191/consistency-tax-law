# The Consistency Tax: A Unifying Framework for Epistemic Thermodynamics

## Quick Start
- **For skeptics**: Read [CRITICAL_EVALUATION.md] - find the flaws
- **For validators**: Run [experiments/] - replicate our results
- **For collaborators**: See [CONTRIBUTING.md] - join the project

## The Claim
Any system maintaining divergence between reality, internal models, and communications pays a thermodynamic cost:

CT = λ · D_KL(P ∥ P*)

This is not metaphor. It's measurable physics.

## Status: Seeking Independent Validation
- ⚠️ Preliminary evidence: Suggestive but not definitive
- ✅ Testable predictions: See [PREDICTIONS.md]
- 🔬 Validation program: See [ROADMAP.md]
